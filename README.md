## My process

So many of the mistakes I made in the previous project which was the recipe page I corrected them I learnt many how to use the concepts I was struggling with and the freecode camp community helped me I learnt how to change fonts better code structure and also some new stuff, it was quite fun.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt it take's work to get better and practice and I am happy over all the major new thing I learnt was hown to add a drop shadow.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.main {
  drop-shadow: 10px 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning more on css and Javascript and do more pracrtice better my skills and eventually start developing more tangible things.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me understand how to add drop shadows to a box or text. I really have been finding w3 schools really helpful and I will continue to use it more later on.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.google.com)google specifically googlefonts helped me know how to change fonts and install them I found the code section really helpful where it showed how to code the fonts or import the fonts.
